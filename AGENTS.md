# KAssetManager Agent Guide
- Scope: Applies repo-wide; no nested AGENTS overrides.
- Platform focus: Windows Qt 6 desktop app built via PowerShell scripts.
- Build (fast dev): powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\build-windows.ps1 -Generator Ninja
- Build (release+package): powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\build-windows.ps1 -Generator "Visual Studio 17 2022" -Package
- Manual CMake: cmake -S native/qt6 -B native/qt6/build/ninja -G Ninja -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="C:/Qt/6.9.3/mingw_64" && ninja -C native/qt6/build/ninja
- Run app: dist/portable/bin/kassetmanagerqt.exe after packaging/install.
- Tests: No automated suite; rely on DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md manual checklist.
- Single test: Not available; target scenario manually instead.
- Linting: No configured tool; preserve CMake formatting and existing whitespace.
- Language: C++20; embrace Qt signal/slot patterns and OpenImageIO helpers.
- Indent 4 spaces; braces stay on the same line; align pointers/references with the type.
- Include order: matching header, Qt headers, standard library, then third-party.
- Naming: Classes PascalCase; functions/locals camelCase; members m_prefix; constants UPPER_SNAKE or kPascalCase.
- Imports: prefer minimal headers, use forward declarations in headers when possible.
- Memory: Rely on Qt parent-child ownership or smart pointers; avoid raw new/delete.
- Error handling: check return values, log with qWarning/qCritical/qDebug, surface user messages via QMessageBox.
- Database: wrap batches in transactions and use prepared statements.
- Threading: keep heavy IO/thumbnail work off the GUI thread via existing async helpers.
- External policies: No Cursor/Copilot rule files detected; keep build scripts succeeding before handoff.
